# **Keyboard Commander**
 Adds distant artillery and combat ambience and morse signals for keyboard inputs.
 
 Get the "Commanding Officer in hearing distance to the frontline while morsing orders to that very frontline" feeling when 
 writing the next rant on Reddit or in the YouTube comment section. Or while you write a ReadMe on GitHub like I do right now with this test build.

## What's planned
 This is what's planned to be done in the foreseeable future in no particular order:
 * Sound balancing
 * getting a better **icon**
 * creating and adding a **shader**
 * creating and adding light/dark themed **wallpapers**
 * generating **browser sounds**
 * adjusting the *WPM count* of the **morse code**

## Installation
 You can install this *GXmod* on your browser by using the ZIP file available. The CRX file will be added later on and
 the ReadMe will be updated accordingly

### Installation with the ZIP file
 1. Click the green __*Code*__ button in the upper right corner and then hit __*Download ZIP*__
    - Extract the ZIP file's content to a location of your choice
 2. **In OperaGX**: type into your URL bar **opera:extensions** and enable __*Developer Mode*__ in the upper right corner
    - Click on *Load Unpacked* and double-click the unpacked ZIP file.
 3. **Done**

### Installation with the CRX file
 * Click on __*Releases*__ right of the file overview
    - Choose the version compatible to your OperaGX version
    - Download the CRX file


 > *NOTE: If you download the .crx in OperaGX it will automatically detect and install it therefore you can ignore the next step*
 * Just drop the CRX file into an open OperaGX window
 * **Done**


#### Proposing Phrases, words to be "sent" with or the WPM of the keyboard sounds
 If you want something specific "sent" you can file an issue with the label **"proposal"** containing at least the following information:
 * Phrase or word
 * The use case (i.e. seasonal) - when no special occasion is given just write "General"
 * Wanted tone frequency (write "same" if you like it at 640Hz) and Words Per Minute speed (WPM) in the fashion of *[yourphrase], [yourWPM]*
